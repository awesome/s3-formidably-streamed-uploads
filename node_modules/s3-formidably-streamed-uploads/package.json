  "readme": "## s3-formidably-streamed-uploads\nWraps knox, knox-mpu and formidable for easy streaming of file uploads directly to S3 without touching the hard drive.  \nKnox-mpu was modified so no temp parts are saved to disk but to an in memory buffer instead.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Take note that when used as an express middlewear, it needs to be the first in a list of many**  \nSee [node formidable's issues comment:] (https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/issues/130#issuecomment-3781889)\n> This is not a problem specific to any module really. It's how node core works, since everything is asynchronous. TCP (and thus HTTP) streams in node emit 'data' events every time a chunk of data is received from the client (this can often happen within the same tick where the incoming connection event occurs). If nobody is listening for data on that stream, then the data is discarded. This technique allows for low memory usage since chunks are emitted as they come in and they are not stored or buffered up anywhere.  Express also does not buffer requests' 'data' events for the same reason node core doesn't (memory usage). Express could support something like that, but I doubt you'll see that added anytime soon.\n>\n> Something else you might try is \"pausing\" the incoming request via req.pause();. This will cause no more 'data' events to be emitted from that request and will start telling the other side to stop sending data. However, one or more 'data' events may already be \"in the pipeline\" and will be emitted even after you pause the incoming request. After you have completed your authentication, you should then be able to do req.resume(); to resume the stream and continue emitted 'data' events.\n>\n> **So, you CAN use async middleware with formidable, but you need to have formidable load before any of these async middleware so that it can capture all of these 'data' events.**\n\nsee: http://anders.janmyr.com/2012/04/writing-node-module.html\n",
